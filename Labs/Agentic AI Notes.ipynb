    "### 1. 🔗 Prompt Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Decompose into fixed sub-tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prompt Chaining](../assets/prompt-chaining.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 What is Prompt Chaining?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt chaining is the technique of breaking a big task into smaller steps by using multiple prompts in a sequence, where the output of one prompt becomes the input of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Analogy: Like a Relay Race 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relay Race Process:**\n",
    "- Runner 1 starts the race\n",
    "- Hands the baton to Runner 2  \n",
    "- Runner 2 runs, then passes to Runner 3\n",
    "- Together, they complete the race\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Prompt Chaining:**\n",
    "- Prompt 1 does the first part of a task\n",
    "- Its output is passed to Prompt 2\n",
    "- Prompt 2 builds on it or refines it, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 🚦 Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Direct an input into a specialized sub-task, ensure separation of concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "![Routing](../assets/routing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 What is Routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing in prompt engineering or AI applications refers to automatically choosing which prompt, model, or logic path to use based on the user's input or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like a traffic director that sends the request to the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Simple Analogy: Call Center\n",
    "\n",
    "**Call Center Process:**\n",
    "- When you call, an automated system asks:\n",
    "  - \"Press 1 for sales, 2 for support, 3 for billing...\"\n",
    "- Based on your input, your call is routed to the right department\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Prompt Workflows:** Routing works the same way - directing requests to the appropriate handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ⚡ Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Breaking down tasks and running multiple subtasks concurrently\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parallelization](../assets/parallelization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 What is Parallelization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization is the process of running multiple tasks at the same time (in parallel) instead of one after another (sequentially).\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps save time and increases efficiency, especially when working with multiple independent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧃 Simple Analogy: Making a Smoothie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Approach:**\n",
    "- 🧍‍♂️ You chop fruits, add milk, and blend — one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Approach:**\n",
    "- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 You ask 3 friends to each do one task at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** You get your smoothie faster! ✅\n",

    "### 4. 🎼 Orchestrator-Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Complex tasks are broken down dynamically and combined\n",
    "\n",
    "![Orchestrator-Worker](../assets/Orchestrator-worker.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 What is Orchestrator-Worker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestrator-Worker is a common architectural pattern where:\n",
    "- **The Orchestrator** controls and coordinates the workflow\n",
    "- **The Workers** do the actual tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a project manager and a team:\n",
    "- The Orchestrator (Manager) decides who does what, when, and how\n",
    "- The Workers (Team Members) perform their specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🍕 Pizza Restaurant Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧑‍🍳 Orchestrator = The Chef Manager**\n",
    "- Takes orders from customers and decides:\n",
    "  - What kind of pizza to make\n",
    "  - Which worker should do what\n",
    "\n",
    "**👨‍🍳 Workers = Kitchen Staff**\n",
    "- One worker rolls the dough 🍞\n",
    "- Another adds toppings 🍅🧀\n",
    "- Another bakes the pizza in the oven 🔥\n",
    "- Another packs it for delivery 📦\n",
    "\n",
    "The manager (orchestrator) doesn't make the pizza — they coordinate the workers who do the actual cooking.\n",

    "### 5. 🔍 Evaluator-Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** LLM output is validated by another\n",
    "\n",
    "![Evaluator-Optimizer](../assets/Evaluator-Optimzer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 What is Evaluator-Optimizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluator-Optimizer is a two-step process used to improve a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluator:** Assesses the current solution and measures how good or bad it is based on criteria or performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizer:** Adjusts the solution to make it better, more accurate, or more efficient based on the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Simple Analogy: Solving a Jigsaw Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluator:**\n",
    "- You look at the puzzle you've completed so far\n",
    "- You evaluate how many pieces are in the right place\n",
    "- You might say: \"This part looks great, but I need to adjust some pieces here\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizer:**\n",
    "- You then try to adjust the pieces — swapping, turning, and moving them around\n",
    "- You keep making tweaks until the puzzle is solved\n",
    "- The Evaluator checks your progress, and the Optimizer makes improvements\n",
